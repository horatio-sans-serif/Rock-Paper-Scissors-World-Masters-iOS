later maybe, based on engagement

- need code to cache and resubmit failed scores for the local player
    - this really is just a single value in the nsuserdefaults since it's monotonically increasing

- code to rate the app
    - after 100 matches have been played
    - "We hope you have enjoyed RPS WORLD MASTERS. Would you mind taking a moment add your rating
       and/or review in the App Store?"

- detect cheaters by those who resign a lot of matches
    - put this info on a server somewhere? track it in the local device?

- rematch button would be a good feature
    - maybe just remember the last playerID played and programmatically invite him?

- consider 2nd leaderboard for players that have played more than 1000 matches 
    - track progress via an achievement
