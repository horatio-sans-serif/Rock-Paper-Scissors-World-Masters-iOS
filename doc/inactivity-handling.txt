Inactivity Handling

    A player has 20 seconds to make a throw.

    If the local player hasn't received the next throw of the remote player
    after 20 seconds, the match is canceled.  The local player is told of the
    situation and is given a placebo alert to report the remote player as
    a cheater.  This does nothing but hopefully prevent the local player from
    giving us a bad review in the App Store.

    What happens when both players disconnect?

        If both players disconnect, the match is automatically canceled by
        virtue of not existing any longer.  Recall that there is no third-party
        mediator keeping track of the match; it's P2P.

    What happens when both players stall or fail to act?

        Both apps will notice the other side stalling and will cancel their
        copy of the match, and show the placebo alert about cheating.  

    What does canceling a match mean?

        Nothing gets reported to a leaderboard, and the match is simply discarded.
